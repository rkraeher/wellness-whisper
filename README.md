# Wellness Whisper

A web-based newsfeed for global news and research on healthcare issues.

## Description

Wellness Whisper aggregates the most up to date news on healthcare around the world and presents articles in one clean and organized news feed. The app scrapes global breaking health-related news and updates the userâ€™s feed in real time. This app is meant for researchers, healthcare workers, and informed patients who want a curated, international, and specialized aggregation of health-related news and publications. We propose to build a news scraper with Python, query our data via Sashido, and present the information in an elegant and mobile responsive React front end UI. 

## Goals
* Provide a truly global source of healthcare news
* Allow users to curate and customize their own news feed
* Distinguish and elevate credible news and information
* Expand healthcare information accessibility

## Development Guidelines
Put all UI components inside a unique folder, named after the component, inside the src/components directory: src/components/Header/index.js, style.css

All API related files can go inside the src/utils directory.
